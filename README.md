# STV: Synagogue Television Display System

![STV Logo](path/to/logo.png)

## Overview

STV is an innovative project designed to enhance television displays in synagogues, making them more accessible, customizable, and easy to update. Our primary goal is to create a vibrant, fluid interface that showcases Jewish values, traditions, and essential information in an engaging way. Built with React and Vite for fast development and performance, this application can be deployed on any web-enabled TV or screen. It emphasizes inclusivity with features like high-contrast modes and multilingual support (English and Hebrew), while incorporating smooth animations for a "flowy" user experience.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Content Display**: Automatically updates and cycles through key information with elegant transitions and animations to keep the display lively and engaging.
- **Customizable Layouts**: Offers pre-built themes (e.g., modern, traditional Jewish motifs) or allows custom designs via the personalization page.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Integrates with external APIs (e.g., for prayer times or Hebrew dates) to ensure accuracy without manual intervention.
- **Admin Panel**: A secure, user-friendly personalization page where admins can modify content, upload images, and preview changes before going live.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Supports screen readers, adjustable font sizes, color-blind modes, and keyboard navigation for broader accessibility.
- **Multi-Screen Support**: Scales to multiple displays across the synagogue with synchronized or location-specific content.
- **Offline Fallback**: Caches essential data for reliable operation during internet outages.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks viewer engagement (e.g., time spent on sections) to refine content over time.

## Information Displayed

STV prominently features the following customizable elements, which can be toggled or rearranged via the admin panel:

- **Time of Day**: Current local time with optional Hebrew clock integration.
- **Synagogue Name and Logo**: Prominently displayed header with customizable branding.
- **Daily Halacha**: A short, daily Jewish law or teaching, pulled from a configurable source or manually entered.
- **Prayer Times**: Automated Zmanim (prayer times) based on location, including sunrise/sunset and holiday adjustments.
- **Leiluy Nishmat Dedications**: Section for memorials and elevations of souls, allowing community members to submit dedications via a form.
- **Hebrew Calendar Date**: Displays the current Hebrew date, including holidays and fasts.
- **Weekly Parsha**: Summary of the Torah portion of the week, with links to deeper resources if online.
- **Upcoming Events**: Calendar view of synagogue events, classes, and services.
- **Inspirational Quotes**: Rotating Jewish wisdom from sources like Pirkei Avot or Chassidic teachings.
- **Announcements and Alerts**: Urgent messages, weather impacts on services, or community news.
- **Donor Recognition**: Optional scrolling ticker for thanking supporters and sponsors.
